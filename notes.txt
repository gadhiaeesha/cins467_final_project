NOTE: right now, Firebase project is only set up for web app

- need to be able to invite members into household
    -> in top_app_bar, when members is clicked, display the link to the website so the new member can login and join Firebase's list of authenticated users
- need to figure out how to show login dialog
- if no households, must ask user to initialize at least one household before displaying anything
